# Word Embedding
### **Question 1**
1. In the code provided there are three mistake which stops the code from running successfully.
a. find those mistakes and explain why they need to be corrected to be able to get the code run.
2. Add embedding layer to the model, did you experience any improvement?
3. Apply the code on 20_newsgroup data set we worked in the previous classes.
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train', shuffle=True, 
categories=categories,)
4. Predict over one sample of data and check what will be the prediction for that.
## Softwares Required :
1. About Word Embedding
2. Python 3.3
3. Jupyter Notebook

## Implementation:
1. Assignment was provided with to understand if the data is positive or negative review data .
2. split the data into to train and test data for training and testing the model.
3. We need to run the word embedding addded neural networks to predict the data
4. predicted the data
